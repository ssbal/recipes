    <p>
      Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back! This Indian
      chickpea curry features a hearty mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion,
      green chili, and warm Indian spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will
      enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and
      enjoy. Namaste y'all!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
      <li>¬Ω teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
      <li>water, as needed</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food
        processor into a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in
        hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the
        skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and
        is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili
        powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until
        very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir just enough water into the mixture to get a thick sauce; bring to a
        boil and stir chickpeas into the sauce. Reduce heat to medium and cook
        until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
